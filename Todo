Todo pre 1.0.18:
    . Make HashHTMLBlocks deal correctly with tags that are *never* closed.
    . Make all the tests pass again!
    . Tests for ignoring stuff.. What happens if I have, say <div /><div id="2">foobar</div> on a line?
    . Make the merging of MDTest more obvious, and get back to the markdown
      mailing list about which tests a) I pass, b) I think should be added to 
      MDTest.
    . Re-merge Movable Type and Bloxom compatibility, and add tests.
    . Need a dingus, write a small / demo app then ask the catalyst guys to 
      host?
      
Todo pre 1.0.19:
    . Generally sort out the code layout so that not all of the code lives in
      MultiMarkdown.pm (i.e. Text::Markdown should stand on it's own, with 
      Text::MultiMarkdown being a superset).
    
Todo pre 1.0.19:
    . http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=33443
    . Document the markdown (and multimarkdown) syntaxes in the module.
    . Stop perl shitting itself due to regex backreference when fixing the 
      list bug (see t/17ulolreportedonlist.t and Markdown mailing list)
      This probably involves the first draught of the new parser...

Todo pre 1.0.20:
   . Have a look at extra features in 
     http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras and put anything 
     we consider useful on the roadmap.
   . Integrate maruku (ruby port) test cases properly, and go looking for 
     more.
   . Have a look at the php markdown extra tests to see if we want to steal 
     any of those features.
     
Todo pre 1.1:
   . Build a parse tree when parsing (which can be returned), rather than just 
     using strings. This would make the output format much more flexible, and
     would remove a load of nasty hacks which escape, then un-escape things
     again whist processing..
